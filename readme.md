# Project Vault City Raiders

A JRPG developed with Godot Engine.

*Still incomplete, only combat works so far, please wait patiently as the rest is being completed.*

## What to expect
Vault City Raiders (project name, actual title to determine) is an old-school style JRPG meant to scratch an itch with modern RPGs.

I basically took elements from every RPG I enjoyed and put them in a blender, the challenge being managing to balance it in a way that's enjoyable for enthusiasts of the genre.

Main influences for this project are Might and Magic 2, Phantasy Star 4, SaGa 1-3 (AKA Final Fantasy Legends), Final Fantasy 7, the Etrian series, and many others.

The final result will be set in a futuristic cyberpunk-lite urban fantasy with a dash of eldritch thrown in, something like Shadowrun but with more robots and old ones.

The core world is set in a reality similar to futuristic planet Earth with familiar names and locations, but taking legends and myths at face value, so there are elves and fairies and dragons. Like, you can have a French elven ESPer and his merry companions fighting a Russian dragon in the streets of New York city with the robot police helping you out.

The game will be structured in 3 main modes:

* Story mode: *A mostly linear and shorter plot-heavy adventure with a fixed, named party and an attempt to introduce the world setting and mechanics to newcomers. **High anime content warning.** The story follows the adventures of the Balmung crew protecting various dimensions from world destroyers and other forms of unspeakable evil.*

* Classic mode: *You create your party from the various available classes and set to raid the titular Vaults, a dimensional maze where anything can happen. This is mostly similar to the Etrian series, but with a world arranged more in the fashion of Might and Magic 2, very exploration heavy.*

* Board mode: *You import your story or classic party into a roguelite experience, neglecting exploration in favor of just events and combat for shorter bursts of gameplay. *

Combat is fairly complex with multiple systems to exploit for optimal strategies. Similarly, enemies are also adept at working together to ruin your day.

So far, only combat is in a semi-operating state.
